## Important
This is only for educational purposes. It's not meant to be used in competitive games.

## Overview
This program aims to simplify the monk micro in Age of Empires 2. When converting enemy units with multiple monks, this program helps deselecting each monk one by one so the rest of the group can target other units.

## Usage
Download the executable from `out` directory or build it with `make build`. The `config.ini` is automatically created with some default values next to the exe when the program first runs. You need to record the position of the units on the bottom left part of the screen so the program knows where to click with `CTRL` + `Click` when deselecting a unit. By default the recording keystroke is `CTRL` + `O` and the `Monk It` action happens when pressing the button `C`. This can be changed in the ini file any time.
